🧠 Overview
The Quantum Nervous System (QNS) Dataset is a precision-engineered, clinically integrable map of quantum biological mechanisms governing neural function, neuroplasticity, and signal coherence across the human nervous system. It bridges quantum physics, epigenetics, bioelectric medicine, ECS modulation, and AI-driven cognitive recalibration.

This system decodes the human nervous system not as a classical network, but as a quantum–epigenetic–resonance engine, complete with frequency-tunable circuits, programmable miRNA codes, and ECS-driven modulation.

🔒 Timestamping & Verification
This dataset has been cryptographically timestamped and publicly verified via GitHub and Zenodo.
It is protected under CC BY-NC 4.0, with authorship priority permanently established.
All versions are tracked and verifiable via commit history + DOI metadata.
